    <h2>Beauty and the beast</h2>
    <p>An enchantress disguised as an old beggar woman arrives at a castle during a ball and offers the host, a cruel and selfish prince, an enchanted rose in return for shelter from a storm. When he refuses, the enchantress transforms him into a beast and his servants into household objects before then erasing the castle, himself, and his servants from the memories of their loved ones and everyone else in the town; unless the Beast can learn to love another and be loved in return before the last petal of the enchanted rose falls, he will be doomed to remain a beast for the remainder of his days while his servants become inanimate.
    Some years later, in the small town of Villeneuve, Belle, the book-loving daughter of a widowed artist named Maurice, dreams of adventure. She constantly brushes off advances from Gaston, an arrogant former soldier as he is not the type of man Belle wishes to marry. On Maurice's way to the market, he becomes lost in the forest and seeks refuge in the Beast's castle. However, the Beast imprisons him when he "stole" a rose from his garden as a gift to Belle. When Maurice's horse returns without him, Belle ventures out in search of him, and finds him locked in the castle dungeon. Belle asks the Beast to let her take his place; the Beast agrees and forces Maurice to leave immediately.</p>

    <p>Belle befriends the castle's servants, including candelabra/footman Lumiere, mantel clock/majordomo Cogsworth, feather-duster/maid Plumette, teapot/housekeeper Mrs. Potts, and her son, Chip, who is now a teacup. They invite her to a spectacular dinner. When she wanders into the forbidden west wing and finds the rose, the Beast scares her into the woods. Belle is ambushed by a pack of wolves, but the Beast rescues her, becoming injured in the process. As Belle nurses his wounds, a spark develops between them. The Beast shows Belle a gift from the enchantress, a book that transports readers wherever they want. Belle uses the book to visit her childhood home in Paris, where she discovers a plague doctor's mask and realizes that she and her father were forced to leave when her mother succumbed to the Bubonic plague.
    In Villeneuve, Maurice fails to convince the other villagers of the Beast and Belle's imprisonment. Gaston, seeing rescuing Belle as an opportunity to win her hand in marriage, agrees to help Maurice. When Maurice learns of his ulterior motive and rejects him, Gaston abandons him to be eaten by the wolves. Maurice is rescued by the town hermit Agathe, but when he tells the townsfolk of Gaston's crime and is unable to provide solid evidence, Gaston convinces them to send Maurice to an insane asylum.</p>

    <p>After sharing a romantic dance with the Beast, Belle discovers her father's predicament using a magic mirror. The Beast releases her to save Maurice, giving her the mirror to remember him with. At Villeneuve, Belle reveals the Beast in the mirror to the townsfolk, proving her father's sanity. Realizing that Belle loves the Beast, a jealous Gaston claims she has been charmed by dark magic and has her thrown into the asylum carriage with her father. He rallies the villagers to follow him to the castle to slay the Beast before he curses the whole village. Inside the asylum carriage, Belle tells her father that she knows what happened to her mother and showed him the rose rattle she took from her magical visit to their old, abandoned home. Maurice and Belle escape, and Belle rushes back to the castle.
    During the battle, Gaston abandons his companion LeFou, who then sides with the servants to fend off the villagers. Meanwhile, he attacks the Beast in his tower, who is too depressed to fight back, but regains his spirit upon seeing Belle return. He defeats Gaston, but spares his life before reuniting with Belle. However, Gaston treacherously shoots the Beast from a bridge, which then collapses as the castle begins to crumble, leading Gaston to fall to his death. The Beast then dies as the last petal falls and the servants become inanimate objects.</p>

     <p>As Belle tearfully professes her love to the Beast, Agathe reveals herself as the enchantress and undoes the curse, repairing the crumbling castle, restoring the Beast and his servants to their human forms and to the villagers' memories. The Prince and Belle host a ball for the kingdom, where they dance happily.</p>



    <h2 id="cinderella story">cinderella story</h2>
    <p>Ella and her parents live happily in a large house with a few servants, until her mother falls ill. Ella promises to follow her mother's dying wish: to have courage and be kind. Years later, Ella's father marries recently-widowed Lady Tremaine, who has two unpleasant daughters, Drizella and Anastasia. Ella's father leaves on business, and Lady Tremaine reveals her cruel and jealous nature, forcing Ella to give up her bedroom to the stepsisters and move into the attic. When Ella's father unexpectedly dies, Lady Tremaine dismisses the household staff to save money, and forces all of their chores upon Ella. Seeing Ella's face covered in cinders after sleeping by the fireplace, her step-family mockingly dubs her "Cinderella". Distraught over her step-family's treatment of her, Ella rides off into the woods, where she encounters Kit, the crown prince, out hunting. He hides that he is a prince, and instead introduces himself as a palace apprentice. Ella and Kit take a liking to each other, but they part without him learning her name. The King discovers he has little time left to live, and urges Kit to take a princess as his bride at the upcoming royal ball. Kit persuades his father to invite every eligible maiden in the kingdom, hoping to see Ella again.  As her step-family is leaving for the ball, Ella attempts to join them, wearing a refashioned dress of her mother's. Tremaine and her daughters destroy the dress and leave Ella behind. She runs out to the garden in tears, and meets an old beggar woman, who reveals herself to be Ella's Fairy Godmother. She magically transforms a pumpkin into a carriage, mice into horses, lizards into footmen, and a goose into the coachman. She then transforms Ella's ripped gown into a beautiful ball gown, and gives her a pair of glass slippers. As Ella departs, the Fairy Godmother warns her the magic will end at the last stroke of midnight, and casts a final spell to prevent Ella's step-family from recognizing her.
    At the ball, Kit is delighted to see Ella and gives her the first dance. The Grand Duke, having promised Kit to the Princess Chelina of Zaragosa for political reasons, expresses his annoyance and is overheard by Lady Tremaine. Though surprised at Kit's true identity, Ella bonds with the Prince. Before she can tell Kit her name, the clock chimes midnight and she flees the palace, losing one of her glass slippers. The Grand Duke pursues her; however, when the magic dissipates, Cinderella is able to hide in the woods. She returns home and hides the remaining glass slipper under the floorboards.
    The King dies, but not before giving his son permission to marry Ella. Now the new king, Kit issues a royal proclamation professing his love for the “mystery princess” and requests she present herself. Ella hurries to retrieve the glass slipper to prove her identity. However, Lady Tremaine has found the slipper first, and declares she will only allow Ella to marry Kit on the condition that Ella make Lady Tremaine head of the royal household and find respectable husbands for the stepsisters. Ella refuses, and Lady Tremaine smashes the slipper and locks Ella in the attic. She brings the remains of the slipper to the Grand Duke, who says he will agree to her terms if she keeps Ella hidden forever.
    The Grand Duke and the Captain of the Guard lead the search for the mystery princess, trying the slipper on every woman in the kingdom, but it refuses to fit anyone. At Ella's house, the shoe fits neither stepsister; the company prepares to depart, then hears Ella singing "Lavender's Blue". The Grand Duke urges them to leave, but Kit, who has secretly accompanied them, commands the Captain to investigate. The slipper fits Ella, and she and Kit promise to accept one another for who they truly are. As they leave, Ella forgives her stepmother. Soon after, Lady Tremaine, her daughters and the Grand Duke leave the kingdom, never to return. Ella and Kit marry and become the kingdom's most beloved monarchs, ruling with the same courage and kindness that Ella had promised her mother.</p>
